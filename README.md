# Weather Report

## Description

This project was created because I wanted to create a site to give a five day weather forcast.
What this does is it retrieves coordinates for a city inputed in the search bar or cities buttons using the Open Weather geo location API. Those coordinates are then used with the Weather API to retrieve the weather data which is displayed on the page.
What I learned from project was how to perform fetch requests with third party APIs and how to traverse the dom to get the information needed.
